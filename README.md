This is my personal website showcasing my skills and project portfolio.

I started building it in the spring of 2025, and as I gain more experience and knowledge, I continuously refine and update it with new features and improvements.

Currently, the site consists of a single page divided into three main sections:

About Me
Projects
Skills
Contact Form

In the near future, I plan to separate these sections into individual pages.

The website was developed with a mobile-first approach and is still a work in progress.

The tools currently used in this project are :
HTML5
CSS3
JAVASCRIPT(ES6+)
GIT

Flexbox and Grid
Mobile first responsivity

Features:
Light-Dark mode switcher

I deploy this website to Netlify, you can see this at: https://personalwebsitextralvl.netlify.app/
