# Personal Portfolio Website

## This is my personal website, showcasing my skills and project portfolio.

I began building it in the spring of 2025.  
As I continue to gain experience and expand my knowledge, I regularly refine and update the site with new features and improvements.

### Currently, the website consists of a single page divided into four main sections:

#### About Me
In this section, I share insights about myself, my goals and plans related to programming, how and why I started learning to code, and some background on my past experiences and jobs.

#### Projects
This section includes a list of my completed and ongoing projects, along with links to their GitHub repositories and live versions hosted on Netlify.

#### Skills
Here I highlight the tools and technologies Iâ€™m currently familiar with. This list grows as I continue learning and exploring new methods and frameworks.

#### Contact Form
You can use this form to get in touch with me directly.

In the near future, I plan to separate these sections into individual pages to improve structure and navigation.  
The website was built using a mobile-first approach and is still under active development.
