# Personal Portfolio Website (Archived)

⚠️ **Caution:** This is an *archived* version of my early personal portfolio website.  
I no longer maintain or update this site, but I’ve kept the repository for reference — as a snapshot of my first full website, which I designed and built entirely on my own in early 2025.

## About the Project

This was my first personal website, created to showcase my skills and projects during the beginning of my web development journey.  
I built it from scratch using a mobile-first approach, and updated it regularly as I progressed.

### The single-page layout includes four sections:

- **About Me** – Personal background, why I started coding, and my future plans.  
- **Projects** – Completed and ongoing projects, with links to GitHub and Netlify.  
- **Skills** – Tools and technologies I learned and used at the time.  
- **Contact** – Simple form to get in touch directly.
