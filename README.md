This is my personal website showcasing my skills and project portfolio.

I started building it in the spring of 2025, and as I gain more experience and knowledge, I continuously refine and update it with new features and improvements.

Currently, the site consists of a single page divided into three main sections:

About Me
Projects
Skills
Contact Form

In the near future, I plan to separate these sections into individual pages.

The website was developed with a mobile-first approach and is still a work in progress.

I deplo this website to Netlify, you can see this at: https://personalwebsitextralvl.netlify.app/
