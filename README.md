<h1>Personal Portfolio Website</h1>
<h2>This is my personal website, showcasing my skills and project portfolio.</h2>

<p>I began building it in the spring of 2025.</p>
<p>As I continue to gain experience and expand my knowledge, I regularly refine and update the site with new features and improvements.</p>

<h3>Currently, the website consists of a single page divided into four main sections:</h3>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>In this section, I share insights about myself, my goals and plans related to programming, how and why I started learning to code, and some background on my past experiences and jobs.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>This section includes a list of my completed and ongoing projects, along with links to their GitHub repositories and live versions hosted on Netlify.</p>

<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Here I highlight the tools and technologies Iâ€™m currently familiar with. This list grows as I continue learning and exploring new methods and frameworks.</p>

<h3>Contact Form</h3>
<p>You can use this form to get in touch with me directly.</p>

<p>In the near future, I plan to separate these sections into individual pages to improve structure and navigation.</p>
<p>The website was built using a mobile-first approach and is still under active development.</p>
